# Development and Implementation of a Kinematic Control System for a Mobile Manipulator(Update soon)
The design and implementation of a kinematic control system for a mobile manipulator, specifically a differential drive robot (Kobuki Turtlebot 2) with a 4 DOF manipulator (uFactory uArm Swift Pro). The goal is to develop a task priority resolution algorithm to control the robotâ€™s movements efficiently.
